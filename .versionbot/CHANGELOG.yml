      body: |-
        Related to https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/issues/1667
        This will allow permission errors to be captured and presented in a
        meaningful way to the end user
        We had a problem to run tests on CI while changing an actual file
        to have to no read access, but the CI runs as root and can read
        any file, to solve it we changed to stub fs.promises.readFile
        raising EACCES instead

      subject: Remove package-lock.json because it is not recommended for libraries
      body: |-
        'package-lock.json' cannot be published to the npm registry, and will
        be ignored when npm-installed by packages that depend on
        resin-multibuild.
        This can lead to dependency-related errors being masked when
        resin-multibuild
        is tested in isolation. Reference:
        https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json
